    This document gives an overview of the major changes of the software since
the last release.

  1.7:
    o Added and "octet" type.
    o Fixed v4 mapped address bug in web100_connection_from_socket().

  1.6:
    o Switched to gtk2-only.
    o Added a "str32" type.
    o Fix a bug in web100_connection_find_v6() causing incorrect matches.

  1.5:
    o Fixed a flush bug on variable writing.
    o Removed some non-existant function declarations in web100.h.
    o Added the python Web100 module and libweb100 swig wrapper.
    o Dropped the "Alpha" prefix since it's really not necessary. :)

  Alpha 1.4:
    o Updated stuner/rtuner to accomodate changes in kernel autotuning.

  Alpha 1.3:
    o The GUI has been rewritten.  The names of the GUI widgets have been
      changed to be more intuitive.
    o The GUI may be built with either GTK+ 1.2 or GTK+ 2.
    o The userland now supports new kernel functionality, such as IPv6,
      /proc file permissions, and autotuning.
    o Updated and added man pages for all library functions.
    o Added the functions web100_get_connection_addrtype and
      web100_get_connection_spec_v6 to the library.
    o Building the GUI may now be disabled using configure.
    o Updated the developers' and users' guide.

  Alpha 1.2:
    o No changes from Alpha 1.2pre2.

  Alpha 1.2pre2:
    o Fixed the binary interface incompatibilities that were introduced
      in Alpha 1.2pre1.  This means that programs which were compiled
      against Alpha 1.1 should continue to work unchanged with the
      Alpha 1.2pre2 libweb100.
    o Made the 'readall' script work on both Alpha 1.2 and 2.0 kernels.

  Alpha 1.2pre1:
    o NOTE: The binary interface to libweb100 has changed slightly.  This
      means that existing applications must be recompiled and relinked
      with libweb100.  However, it is very likely that the recompile will
      not require changes to existing source code.
    o Added support for both IPv4 and IPv6 types from the kernel (previous
      versions of the library would crash if the kernel returned IPv6
      values).
    o Added support for logging values from the kernel
    o Addition of 'readvarm' and 'readconn' scripts
    o Addition of man pages for many functions, such as the snapshot and
      logging functions (some are only stubs).
    o Many GUI improvements and cleanups
    o Updates and cleanups to the developer's and user's guide.
    o Removed some items from web100.h that were not meant to be public
    o Support building on systems which do not have socklen_t

  Alpha 1.1:
    o GUI fixes: Renamed "util" to "gutil", fixed the vdt display,
      consolidation of code, miscellaneous bug and display fixes.
    o writevar fixed so that it works for integers
    o Added web100_connection_from_socket() and web100_value_to_textn()
      to libweb100.
    o Bug fixes in libweb100, such as for _find() and _lookup()
      functions.
    o Documentation updates and additions, such as the developer's
      guide, user's guide, and man pages for some libweb100 API
      functions (see "man libweb100").

  Alpha 1.0:
    o First public release
